# enumerable_methods
>Implementation of Ruby Enumerable methods.
## Live Demo 
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/mohamedSabry0/enumerable_methods)](https://repl.it/github/mohamedSabry0/enumerable_methods)
## Built With

- Ruby.

## Implemented methods
`my_each`
`my_each_with_index`
`my_select`
`my_all?`
`my_any?`
`my_none?`
`my_count`
`my_map`
`my_inject`

## Getting Started 
**In order to start `name_of_method` you can use `name_of_method` either with a block or with special use cases specific to each one**
**for `my_each`, `my_each_with_index`, `my_select`, `my_map` if you didn't use a block it will return enumerator**
**If you didn't use a block with `my_all?`, `my_any?`, `my_none?` it will return true or false based on all of the elements of the enum**
**for `my_count` if you didn't pass anything it will count all of the enum elements. However, it will count the elements equal to the argument if you passed one**
**you can pass either a proc or a block to `my_map` method. However, a proc has higher presedence over a block**
**if you used `my_inject` with a block you can pass an initial value as an argument like `my_inject(value){block}` or without an initial and it will use the first item as the intial value for the accumulator**
**you can use `my_inject` with a symbol representing an operation instead of a block**
**if you used `my_inject` with a symbol you can also pass an initial value like `my_inject(intial,sym)` or without initial `my_inject(sym)`**
